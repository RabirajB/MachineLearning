# Machine-Learning Projects
Codes containing implementation of Various Machine Learning Algorithms.<br>
The codes can be downloaded individually and run using Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Descriptions:<br>
Project1 : Logistic Regression on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from Scratch <br>
Project2 Part1: Neural Networks from scratch on Fashion MNIST Dataset <br>
Project2 Part2: Neural Networks using Keras that uses Linear Sigmoidal units and Softmax unix for Classification <br>
Project2 Part3: Neural Networks using Keras following the design pattern of Convolutional Neural Networks <br>
Project3 Part1: Demonstrating K-Means clustering algorithm on Fashion MNIST dataset using Scikit-Learn <br>
Project3 Part2 and Part3: Demonstraing K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model based Clustering Algorithms on reduced representations of Fashion MNIST dataset obtained by using AutoEncoders designed using Keras <br>
